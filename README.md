# Spectral Clustering

This repository contains implementations of various clustering algorithms using NumPy, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Radial Basis Function (RBF), K-Means, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and Mutual Information (MI).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulation.

## 📚 Project Description

The Spectral Clustering project focuses on implementing and demonstrating various clustering algorithms using Python and NumPy. Clustering is a crucial technique in unsupervised machine learning used to group similar data points together. This repository includes implementations of:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**
- **Mutual Information (MI)**

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a clear and efficient implementation of several clustering algorithms and evaluation metrics using NumPy, making it easier for learners and practitioners to understand and apply these techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: An algorithm used for classification and regression based on the distance to the nearest neighbors.
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF)**: A function used in various machine learning models, including support vector machines and RBF networks.
- **K-Means Clustering**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into k distinct clusters based on distance.
- **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**: A metric used to measure the similarity between two data clusterings.
- **Mutual Information (MI)**: A measure of the mutual dependence between two variables.
